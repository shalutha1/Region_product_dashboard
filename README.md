# Regional Sales Overview with Power BI

I’m excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of our sales data, broken down by region. This interactive dashboard allows for a clear understanding of sales performance across different regions, highlighting key metrics such as total revenue, quantity sold, and customer demographics.

### Key features include:
- **Total Revenue & Sales Breakdown by Region** 🌍
- **Product Performance by Colour and Category** 🎨
- **Detailed Regional Analysis for Informed Decision-Making** 💡
- **Salesperson and City Data Insights** 📈

This tool has been invaluable in helping track regional sales trends and make strategic decisions based on real-time data. 

Feel free to explore and let me know your thoughts!
